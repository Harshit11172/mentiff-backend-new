# mentiff-backend-new
New backend repo for mentiff


For a Mentor he should connect with the google calendar at first 

I have create two models for same task that i need to change.
1. Mentorship/models
2. Voice_video/models
sessions and booking

two api for same thing just different field
rn, link is being gen by create/session api in voice_video

but payment is linked with mentorship session model



Rn im using mentor to authenticate for google calendar and made the logic for 6 hrs to 7 days booking only

also made payment logic just need to connect it

thought of making a mentiff own calendar where all links can be saved and used to track mentor availability.
